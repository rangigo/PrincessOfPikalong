## Introduction: 
	
"Princess of Pikalong" is a 2D Japan-style role-playing puzzle game powered by Unity and made for Windows PC. 

This is the first ever Game Project by 3 first-year students from Helsinki-Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.

The game is the result of over a month of self-study as well as designing with the help from teachers and sources online (reference at the end of the document). 

"Princess of Pikalong" is entirely Indie. All game arts and sprites are taken online (reference below). Therefore, it is for
learning and reference purpose ONLY.
